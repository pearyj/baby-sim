I created this simple text-based game after watching many of my friends - people my own age - embark on parenthood and face firsthand the joys, surprises, and challenges of raising a child. Through this simulator, I hope to give players a small glimpse into the difficult choices, sweet milestones, and sometimes unexpected hurdles that come with caring for a little one.\nIt's also extra fun to play with someone else! Debating each tough question together can be a fast (and often hilarious) way to discover whether you'd make great co-parents in real life.\nI poured my own curiosity, respect, and a touch of empathy into every scenario, and your feedback and stories are what keep this project growing, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts or suggestions.\nHappy parenting (in simulation),\n— pearyj",
