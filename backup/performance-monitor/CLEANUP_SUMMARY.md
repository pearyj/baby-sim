# Performance Monitor Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Files Backed Up
- ✅ `src/utils/performanceMonitor.ts` → `backup/performance-monitor/performanceMonitor.ts`
- ✅ `src/components/dev/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` → `backup/performance-monitor/PerformanceMonitor.tsx`
- ✅ Created comprehensive restoration guide in `backup/performance-monitor/README.md`

### 2. Files Completely Removed
- ✅ `src/utils/performanceMonitor.ts` - Deleted
- ✅ `src/components/dev/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Deleted

### 3. Files Cleaned Up (Performance Monitor Usage Removed)

#### ✅ `src/App.tsx`
- Removed import: `import { performanceMonitor } from './utils/performanceMonitor'`
- Removed import: `import { PerformanceMonitor } from './components/dev/PerformanceMonitor'`
- Removed usage: `performanceMonitor.timeSync('render-main-content', 'ui', ...)`
- Removed component: `{isDevelopment && <PerformanceMonitor />}`

#### ✅ `src/components/dev/index.ts`
- Removed export: `export { PerformanceMonitor } from './PerformanceMonitor';`

#### ✅ `src/services/streamingService.ts`
- Removed import: `import { performanceMonitor } from '../utils/performanceMonitor';`
- Removed all `performanceMonitor.startTiming()` calls
- Removed all `performanceMonitor.endTiming()` calls
- Replaced with appropriate logger calls

#### ✅ `src/services/imageGenerationService.ts`
- Removed import: `import { performanceMonitor } from '../utils/performanceMonitor';`
- Removed: `performanceMonitor.timeAsync('generateEndingImage', 'api', ...)`
- Simplified function structure by removing performance wrapper

#### ✅ `src/services/gptServiceUnified.ts`
- Removed import: `import { performanceMonitor } from '../utils/performanceMonitor';`
- Removed all `performanceMonitor.startTiming()` and `performanceMonitor.endTiming()` calls
- Removed all `performanceMonitor.timeAsync()` and `performanceMonitor.timeSync()` wrappers
- Simplified function structures in:
  - `makeModelRequest()`
  - `generateQuestionSync()`
  - `generateOutcomeAndNextQuestionSync()`
  - `generateInitialStateSync()`
  - `generateEndingSync()`

#### ✅ `src/stores/useGameStore.ts`
- Removed import: `import { performanceMonitor } from '../utils/performanceMonitor';`
- Removed performance monitoring calls in `initializeGame()` method
- Simplified timing and removed performance wrappers

## Code Changes Summary

### Before Cleanup
The performance monitor system included:
- **1 utility file** with comprehensive timing functionality
- **1 React component** for real-time performance visualization
- **Performance timing calls** scattered across 6+ service files
- **UI component** displayed in development mode
- **Global performance object** available in browser console

### After Cleanup
- ✅ All performance monitoring code removed from main codebase
- ✅ Clean, production-ready code without performance overhead
- ✅ Complete backup preserved for future restoration if needed
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for restoration process

## Features Removed
- Real-time performance tracking (API, local, UI operations)
- Performance metrics categorization
- Visual performance dashboard
- Development-mode performance monitor UI
- Browser console `perf` debugging object
- Comprehensive timing for sync/async operations
- Performance reports and summaries

## Restoration Process
If performance monitoring is needed in the future, follow the detailed restoration guide in `backup/performance-monitor/README.md`.

## Verification
The cleanup was successful - no references to `performanceMonitor` remain in the active codebase. The code is now cleaner and more maintainable without the performance monitoring overhead.
